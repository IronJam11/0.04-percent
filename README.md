<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The centralized carbon credit market suffers from inefficiencies, including lack of transparency, high costs, price manipulation, and slow verification processes, which hinder small-scale reforestation developers and create uncertainty for investors. Our project aims to solve these issues by decentralizing the carbon credit market using blockchain and AI.

We introduce Carbon Coin, an ERC-20 token, to create a transparent marketplace where developers submit reforestation project details. Using satellite imaging and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), we verify project legitimacy and calculate carbon credits. By comparing imagery from the start of the project to the date of the transaction, we can accurately assess the carbon reduction. NDVI helps measure vegetation quality, ensuring that the credits reflect genuine environmental impact.

Through machine learning models, we automate project verification, and smart contracts mint Carbon Coins, reducing middlemen, preventing manipulation, and providing standardized pricing. The decentralized ledger ensures transparency, eliminating issues like double counting and fraud, giving investors confidence in the integrity of the credits.

By combining blockchain, AI, and satellite technology, we’re creating a more efficient, fair, and impactful carbon credit market, driving meaningful action in the fight against climate change.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The centralized carbon credit market suffers from inefficiencies such as a lack of transparency, high intermediation costs, price manipulation, and a slow verification process. Brokers and third-party verifiers inflate costs, making it difficult for small-scale reforestation developers to participate. Additionally, carbon credit prices fluctuate due to regulatory differences and speculative trading, creating uncertainty for investors. Fraud, including double counting of credits, further undermines trust in the system. Our project solves these issues by decentralizing the carbon credit market using blockchain and AI. By introducing an ERC-20 token, Carbon Coin, we create a transparent and accessible marketplace where developers submit reforestation project details, and an DL model verifies their legitimacy. This eliminates middlemen, reduces costs, and ensures credits are issued based on actual carbon reduction. Smart contracts automate the minting of Carbon Coins, preventing manipulation and ensuring a standardized pricing mechanism. The decentralized ledger prevents double counting, giving investors confidence that each credit represents genuine carbon offsetting. By leveraging AI and blockchain, we make the carbon credit market more efficient, fair, and impactful in the fight against climate change. Plus this project holds a huge scope for extension and innovation that couldn't be implemented due to financial and time barriers. From integrating NLP for project document verification to extending the diversity of eco-projects by including Solar Projects and Hydro Projects, this project has an endless domain of innovation and extension which can be achieved with appropriate resources.
